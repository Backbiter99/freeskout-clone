# freeskout-clone

This is the first time I have attempted any such project.
This project involves application of HTML and CSS and I completed it after learning from the online resource [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard). I also took help from ChatGPT to complete this project.

The website is hosted [here](https://backbiter99.github.io/freeskout-clone/).
